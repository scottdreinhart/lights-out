/**
 * Connect-Four AI Service
 *
 * Scale-aware orchestration for minimax AI:
 * - Sync path: Direct JS minimax (< 100ms for shallow depths)
 * - Async path: Worker-backed with timeout fallback (up to 500ms)
 *
 * Decision tree:
 *   easy (depth 1): Sync only, always < 10ms
 *   medium (depth 4): Optional async, typically 60-100ms; worker if needed
 *   hard (depth 8): Async required, typically 150-500ms; timeout to sync fallback
 *
 * WASM-first: Worker prefers WASM bitboard (~10x faster), falls back to JS minimax.

 *   3. If timeout, fall back to sync JS on main thread

 * Suitable for:

 *   - Ensuring UI responsiveness even during complex AI searches
 *   - Graceful degradation when workers fail
 *
 * Performance targets:
 *   - Easy: 10-20ms (worker overkill; use sync)

 *   - Hard: 150-500ms (worker essential, timeout fallback safe)
